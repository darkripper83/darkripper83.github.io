        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a designer-slash-programmer based in Naples, Italy.
        I make Unity and Twine videogames and websites, for fun and profit.</p>

        <h2>My Tools of the Trade</h2>
		  
		<p>I do web design the old-fashioned way, with a text editor.</p>
		  
		<p>For 3d stuff I use mostly Modo and Blender.</p>
		
		<p>My Unity games are made using C#, which I'm currently learning.</p>
